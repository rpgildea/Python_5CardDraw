# Python_5CardDraw

DESCRIPTION
This project is an implementation of 5 Card Draw Poker using Python 3.6(32-bit) and JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition 2018.1.2. The 
computer that I'm using is a HP ProBook 450 G1 and is running Windows 10 Pro. The project is an on-going project during my free time but 
the code provided runs the basics to keep a game running. The game is similar to Jacks or Better but instead of earning back the bet 
through a pair of jacks or better, the player will receive the credit back for all pairs. Additionally, the project will eventually 
include a user interface. I plan on using Kivy to develop the user interface.
